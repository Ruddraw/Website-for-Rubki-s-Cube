          Welcome to the world of SpeedCubing. I am AFIF ASAD RUDDRAW, a
          hobbiest speedcuber. I created this website to show the rubik's cube I
          use as my main cube. I chosed these cubes based on their performance,
          feels, customization ability, and price. Hpoe you like it.

            Valk2 M is the first 2x2 produced in the iconic Valk line. Coming in
            at a slightly larger than the normal 51mm, this puzzle is solidly
            built with a stable and more substantial feel.The magnet positions
            on this 2x2 are unlike any seen on the market. Rather than the
            typical corner-only magnet layout, the Valk2 M uses a corner/edge
            magnet layout resembling that of a 3x3. This gives the puzzle a
            smaller magnetic radius making the feel more consistent throughout
            the turn.

            The GAN 11 M Pro is GAN's upcoming 2020 flagship 3x3 magnetic speed cube. Built with an omnidirectional magnetic core, this cube delivers a unique, enhanced magnetic feel that is also easy to adjust.GAN's new omnidirectional magnetic core is the industry's first corner-core magnetic positioning system. In addition to the 48 traditionally placed magnets inside the cube's pieces, the GAN 11 M Pro features 8 pairs of magnets stemming from the core to each corner base. This magnetic positioning system creates a consistent magnetic feel that is strong without an aggressive snap.The GAN 11 M Pro features the same dual adjustment system as the popular GAN 356 XS. Use the included adjustment tool to set elasticity to 6 different levels. Tension by hand to 4 different settings with the smaller blue nut.

            The QiYi Mini WuQue 4x4 M is a smaller more compact version of the world's most successful 4x4 speed cube, the QiYi WuQue. The Mini measures 2mm smaller and has a fast, light, and crispy feel making it easy to turn.
            This is an old cube. I don't do 4X4 that at all so I didn;t upgrade it.

            The QiYi MoFangGe WuShuang 5x5 is now available! At 62mm across, this new 5x5 is just a little bit smaller than most mainstream 5x5 speedcubes. Out of the box, it is buttery-smooth on all layers, and it boasts excellent corner-cutting freedom.Same as 4X4 I don't dp 5X5 anymore.

            The Shadow M is a factory magnetized 6x6 speed cube produced by X-Man Design. At just 189 grams, the Shadow is a lightweight but stable cube, and has a wide variety of features including premium quality ABS primary internals, an anti-dislodgement internal mechanism, and a smooth, buttery feel. This cube features magnetic grooves for precise magnet placement. This is also one of the events which I don't find interesting so I don't do them anymore.

            The X-Man Design Spark 7x7 M is a magnetic 7x7 designed specifically for speed solving. It features a smaller, lighter design with a medium to strong magnetic feel. These features make the Spark exceptionally stable, reliable, and easy to turn. Max Park used this puzzle to set the 1:40.89 single and 1:46.57 average 7x7 world records in August 2019 and January 2020 respectively.
